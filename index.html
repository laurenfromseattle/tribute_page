                        <p>
                            "Cherub Rock" was one of the last songs written for
                            the album. The lyrics relate to Corgan's
                            relationship with his perception of the indie rock
                            community and larger media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The song is performed in standard tuning with an E
                            octave played at the 7th fret, a technique which
                            the band used on other songs, such as "Drown",
                            "Tristessa", and "Starla." Corgan describes this as
                            the "Pumpkin Chord," saying, "We basically stole
                            that from Jimi Hendrix. But Jimi Hendrix probably
                            stole it from Wes Montgomery."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The prominent effect on the solo was achieved by
                            recording the guitar solo to two different tapes
                            which were then run simultaneously, with the speed
                            of one tape slightly altered. "Cherub Rock"
                            contains various overdubs influenced by the genres
                            of shoegazing as well as 1970s classic arena rock.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Corgan insisted the track be released as the first
                            single, though record executives believed that
                            "Today" would be a stronger opening single.
                            Although Corgan's wishes were honored, the single
                            was indeed received much less enthusiastically than
                            "Today", although it remains a fan favorite.

                            Today is the greatest<br />
                            Day I've ever known<br />
                            Can't live for tomorrow,<br />
                            Tomorrow's much too long<br />
                            I'll burn my eyes out<br />
                            Before I get out

                        <p>
                            I wanted more<br />
                            Than life could ever grant me<br />
                            Bored by the chore<br />
                            Of saving face

                            Can't wait for tomorrow<br />
                            I might not have that long<br />
                            I'll tear my heart out<br />
                            Before I get out

                            Pink ribbon scars<br />
                            That never forget<br />
                            I tried so hard<br />
                            To cleanse these regrets<br />
                            My angel wings<br />
                            Were bruised and restrained<br />
                            My belly stings

                            Today is<br />
                            The greatest day

                            Faith lies in<br />
                            The ways of sin<br />
                            I chased the charmed<br />
                            But I don't want them anymore
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And in their eyes I was alive<br />
                            A fool's disguise<br />
                            Take me away from you
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Shame my tongue<br />
                            Fat with promise all along<br />
                            But when I woke up from that sleep<br />
                            I was happier than I'd ever been
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When you decide<br />
                            That your life is a prize<br />
                            Renew and rivive<br />
                            It's alright honey<br />
                            It's alright, yeah

                        <p>
                            Happiness will make you wonder<br />
                            Will I feel OK?<br />
                            It scares the disenchanted<br />
                            Far away

                        <p>
                            Yeah I want something new<br />
                            But what am I supposed to do about you<br />
                            Yeah I love you, it's true

                            Dream of your own life<br />
                            I miss me<br />

                            A mark of scorn to you

                            Consume my love, devour my hate<br />
                            Only powers my escape<br />

                            Disarm you with a smile<br />
                            And cut you like you want me to<br />
                            Cut that little child<br />
                            Inside of me and such a part of you<br />
                            Ooh, the years burn<br />
                            Ooh, the years burn

                        <p>
                            I used to be a little boy<br />
                            So old in my shoes<br />
                            And what I choose is my choice<br />
                            What's a boy supposed to do?<br />
                            The killer in me is the killer in you<br />
                            My love<br />
                            I send this smile over to you

                            And leave you like they left me here<br />
                            To wither in denial<br />
                            The bitterness of one who's left alone<br />
                            Ooh, the years burn<br />
                            Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn
                        </p>

                            Nothing left to say<br />
                            And all I've left to do<br />
                            Is run away<br />
                            From you<br />
                            And she led me on, down<br />
                            With secrets I can't keep

                        <p>
                            Close your eyes and sleep<br />
                            Don't wait up for me<br />
                            Hush now don't you speak<br />
                            To me

                        <p>
                            Wrapped my hurt in you<br />
                            And took my shelter in that pain<br />
                            The opiate of blame<br />
                            Is your broken heart, your heart

                            Didn't want to be your friend<br />
                            Fulfilled a promise made of tin<br />
                            And crawled back to you

                            While the harlots of my perils<br />
                            Scream
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And I fail<br />
                            But when I can, I will<br />
                            Try to understand<br />
                            That when I can, I will

                            Mother weep the years I'm missing<br />
                            All our time can't be given<br />
                            Back<br />
                            Shut my mouth and strike the demons<br />
                            That cursed you and your reasons<br />
                            Out of hand and out of season<br />
                            Out of love and out of feeling<br />
                            So bad
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I can, I will<br />
                            Words defy the plan<br />
                            When I can, I will

                        <p>
                            Fool enough to almost be it<br />
                            And cool enough to not quite see it<br />
                            And old enough to always feel this<br />
                            Always old, I'll always feel this
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            No more promise no more sorrow<br />
                            No longer will I follow<br />
                            Can anybody hear me<br />
                            I just want to be me<br />
                            When I can, I will<br />
                            Try to understand<br />
                            That when I can, I will
