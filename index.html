            <p>
              "Cherub Rock" was one of the last songs written for the album. The
              lyrics relate to Corgan's relationship with his perception of the
              indie rock community and larger media.
            </p>
            <p>
              The song is performed in standard tuning with an E octave played
              at the 7th fret, a technique which the band used on other songs,
              such as "Drown", "Tristessa", and "Starla." Corgan describes this
              as the "Pumpkin Chord," saying, "We basically stole that from Jimi
              Hendrix. But Jimi Hendrix probably stole it from Wes Montgomery."
            </p>
            <p>
              The prominent effect on the solo was achieved by recording the
              guitar solo to two different tapes which were then run
              simultaneously, with the speed of one tape slightly altered.
              "Cherub Rock" contains various overdubs influenced by the genres
              of shoegazing as well as 1970s classic arena rock.
            </p>
            <p>
              Corgan insisted the track be released as the first single, though
              record executives believed that "Today" would be a stronger
              opening single. Although Corgan's wishes were honored, the single
              was indeed received much less enthusiastically than "Today",
              although it remains a fan favorite.
            </p>
            <p>
              Readers ranked "Cherub Rock" at number 97 in Guitar World's list
              of the 100 greatest guitar solos of all time.In March 2005, Q
              magazine placed it at number 67 in its list of the 100 Greatest
              Guitar Tracks.

              Quiet, I am sleeping<br />
              In here, we need a little hope<br />
              For years, I've been sleeping <br />
              Helpless, couldn't tell a soul

              Castrate boys to the bone<br />
              Jesus, are you listening?<br />
              Up there to anyone at all
